Public space could be more inviting to come together, exchange ideas and create community. It could be socially more just, it could bring humans into the center of a city, instead of cars...by:

- Building circular-design public spaces
- Integrating nature like trees and parks more
- Reduce space that is occupied by cars, parking space, street lanes etc.
